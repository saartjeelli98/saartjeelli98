<p>I am currently a student at Promineo Tech learning front end development. We are learning many technologies including JavaScript, Algorithms, OOP, Design Patterns, Unit Testing, HTML, CSS, React, and more! I am excited for this journey because I have the opportunity to connect with others new to the development world and to learn from experienced people in the industry. I am looking forward to starting new projects both in association with the program but also in my own time. Soon I hope to be making user-friendly, design-focused work.</p>
